# Logistic-Regression_IRIS
Predicting the class of Iris flower.

Here we are using sklearn.datasets iris flower dataset to train the model using logistic regression. we need to use the model to predict different samples in the test dataset. In iris dataset there are 150 samples containing following features,

1. Sepal Length
2. Sepal Width 
3. Petal Length 
4. Petal Width

Using above 4 features we will clasify a flower in one of the three categories,

0. Setosa
1. Versicolour
2. Virginica
